## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an iOS developer with experience in creating 6 apps, actively participating in the entire process, from ideation and research to prototyping, development, testing and publishing on the App Store.
During my time at the Apple Developer Academy, I developed solid skills in Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, and native frameworks, experience with automated tests and CI/CD pipelines, as well as with several design patterns and MVVM, MVC and VIPER architectures.
